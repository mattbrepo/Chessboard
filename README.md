# Chessboard
Draw a chessboard (for calibration of a two cameras system for stereophotogrammetry)

*Language: Java / Processing*

## Why
I was working on [Stereophotogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) project based on a two cameras system that needed to be calibrated. In order to do that a chessboard was used to calculate the model of the 3D world. The project involved the use of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). Anyway this simple [Processing](https://processing.org/) program was quite helpful while preparing all the needed chessboards.
